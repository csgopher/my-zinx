Zinx is a lightweight network application framework based on Golang, used for rapid development of high-performance server applications. 

It adopts an event-driven design pattern, allowing developers to handle network events conveniently through a set of callback functions.

I have studied the source code of Zinx and plan to use it for game servers, which I think will be very interesting :)
